   <p>An “About Us” Page is where you reveal your brand story, company values, mission, and experiences. 

Now the question is: why would you want to share all this information and make it appealing? The answer is simple: you want to tell your audience who you are and show them what you are good at. This page will also build trust. .

Think for a moment: would you rather purchase from a business you know nothing about, or would you go for somebody with a friendly face shared on their About page and a story that you find exciting? The latter one, right? </p>
